## Act

[**Act** 🔗](https://github.com/nektos/act) provides some **local testing capabilities** to your GitHub Actions workflows.

🌴 So you can design some workflows to test your action locally.

🏜️ Otherwise, you will need to run thoses workflows like any others.

⚠️ But **Act** have limitations (some steps need the GitHub Actions ecosystem to run)

# TODO Life and death of an action

- maintainer lessons
  - Project ideas come from everywhere, don't limit yourself and create a public repository even when you may be the only user.
  - Don't be perfect from the start, you can improve your project during its lifetime.
  - You can choose any name for your project, sometimes a descriptive name, sometimes a play of words.
  - Learn to say no as Maintainer or to choose your own way to deal with a situation.
  - Don't support all releases of your project all the time, you can depreciate version series.
  - Don't be afraid to archived a project if you unmaintained it.
  - Don't put yourself under pressure to respond quickly as possible to issues or pull-requests submissions.
- Branch maintenance
  - avoid 'main'
  - [security maintenance](https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/blob/v4.x/SECURITY.md)
  - lifecycle (maintained only 2 branches)
- Deprecation of an input

# Create an action

You can create an action from scratch based on an idea or you can extract some steps from a workflow and turn it into an action.
Not everything should be an action but anything could became an action.

Before start a new action, the question you may ask youself is

> This will do a defined task?

Using Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle, you can separate the orchestration of tasks (Workflow) from the underlying tasks (Action or step in a workflow).
